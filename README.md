# Delete-files-older-than-and-empty-directories
Simple script ready to be copy-pasted into task scheduler.

I am new if it comes to scripting, so for sure it could have been written better, but it does it's job.

Before running the script, set the value of $whatif to "$true" to test the script itself. It will inform you what will be deleted. 

The script should be self explanatory since it does have a lot of comments. Feel free to edit it to make it fitting to your needs.

This script was written mainly thanks to Ruud's article which you can find here https://lazyadmin.nl/it/remove-empty-directories-with-powershell/.
